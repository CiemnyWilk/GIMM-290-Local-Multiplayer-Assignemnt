Assignment 1 Changes:

P1 Controls:
WASD to move with left shift to jump

P2 Controls:
Arrow keys to move with Numpad 0 to move

Abilities:
Three abilities randomly spawn around the map. the abilities are immunity, a speed boost, and a jump boost.

UI:
I added a score counter on the screen that actively changes and a win screen when the player reaches 10 points.

Scenes:
There is a test scene that I was using for testing random stuff and a scene that has an actual level with obstacles.

Game Design tool used:
I made a goal so players could feel pressured to try and attack as without a goal people would either hide or get bored very quickly. This goal was to try and reach 10 points to win the game.

Known bugs:
Some of the 3d models go off the screen and I just didn't have time to adjust them
The jump issue is sometimes no longer working. It can be fixed by just walking up something and falling again. (this bug is due to an issue with how Unity runs its OnTriggerEnter)


Assignment 2 Changes:

As I have already added a scoring system with UI I instead added a main menu that can exit the game and select a level.

Assignment 3 Changes:

Added manager system and updated score counter to use it. Added interactable cubes that can be pushed around. No Changes made to the Main Menu.
